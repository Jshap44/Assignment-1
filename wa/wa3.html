    <h1>Black Hole</h1>

    <p>A black hole is a region of spacetime where gravity is so strong that nothing, not even light, can escape it.<br>
        [2] Albert Einstein's theory of general relativity predicts that <br>
        a sufficiently compact mass can deform spacetime to form a black hole. <br>
        [3][4] The boundary of no escape is called the event horizon.<br>
        A black hole has a great effect on the fate and circumstances of an object crossing it, <br> 
        but has no locally detectable features according to general relativity.<br>
        [5] In many ways, a black hole acts like an ideal black body, as it reflects no light.<br>
        [6][7] Quantum field theory in curved spacetime predicts that event horizons emit Hawking radiation,<br>
        with the same spectrum as a black body of a temperature inversely proportional to its mass.<br>
        This temperature is of the order of billionths of a kelvin for stellar black holes, making it <br>
        essentially impossible to observe directly.Objects whose gravitational fields are too strong for light to 
        escape was first considered in the 18th century by John Michell and Pierre-Simon Laplace. <br>
        In 1916, Karl Schwarzschild found the first modern solution of general relativity that would characterise a black hole. <br>
        Due to his influential research, the Schwarzschild metric is named after him. David Finkelstein, in 1958, first published <br>
        the interpretation of "black hole" as a region of space from which nothing can escape. Black holes were long considered <br>
        a mathematical curiosity; it was not until the 1960s that theoretical work showed they were a generic prediction of general relativity.<br>
        The discovery of neutron stars by Jocelyn Bell Burnell in 1967 sparked interest in gravitationally collapsed compact objects as <br>
        a possible astrophysical reality. The first black hole known was Cygnus X-1, identified by several researchers independently in 1971.<br>
        [8][9]Black holes of stellar mass form when massive stars collapse at the end of their life cycle. <br>
        After a black hole has formed, it can grow by absorbing mass from its surroundings. Supermassive black holes of <br>
        millions of solar masses (Mâ˜‰) may form by absorbing other stars and merging with other black holes, or via direct collapse of gas clouds. <br>
        There is consensus that supermassive black holes exist in the centres of most galaxies. The presence of a black hole <br>
        can be inferred through its interaction with other matter and with electromagnetic radiation such as visible light. Any matter that falls toward a <br> 
        black hole can form an external accretion disk heated by friction, forming quasars, some of the brightest objects in the universe. Stars passing <br>
        too close to a supermassive black hole can be shredded into streamers that shine very brightly before being "swallowed."[10] If other stars are orbiting <br> 
        a black hole, their orbits can be used to determine the black hole's mass and location. Such observations can be used to exclude possible alternatives such <br>
        as neutron stars. In this way, astronomers have identified numerous stellar black hole candidates in binary systems and established that the radio source <br>
        known as Sagittarius A*, at the core of the Milky Way galaxy, contains a supermassive black hole of about 4.3 million solar masses. <br>
