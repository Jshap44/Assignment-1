        A black hole is a region of spacetime where gravity is so strong that nothing, not even light, can escape it. [2] 
        Albert Einstein's theory of general relativity predicts that a sufficiently compact mass can deform spacetime to form a black hole. [3][4] 
        The boundary of no escape is called the event horizon. A black hole has a great effect on the fate and circumstances of an object crossing it, 
        but has no locally detectable features according to general relativity. [5] In many ways, a black hole acts like an ideal black body, 
        as it reflects no light. [6][7] Quantum field theory in curved spacetime predicts that event horizons emit Hawking radiation, 
        with the same spectrum as a black body of a temperature inversely proportional to its mass. This temperature is of the order of billionths 
        of a kelvin for stellar black holes, making it essentially impossible to observe directly. Objects whose gravitational fields are too strong 
        for light to escape were first considered in the 18th century by John Michell and Pierre-Simon Laplace. 
        
        In 1916, Karl Schwarzschild found the first modern solution of general relativity that would characterize a black hole. Due to his influential 
        research, the Schwarzschild metric is named after him. David Finkelstein, in 1958, first published the interpretation of "black hole" as a 
        region of space from which nothing can escape. Black holes were long considered a mathematical curiosity; it was not until the 1960s that 
        theoretical work showed they were a generic prediction of general relativity. The discovery of neutron stars by Jocelyn Bell Burnell in 1967 
        sparked interest in gravitationally collapsed compact objects as a possible astrophysical reality. The first black hole known was Cygnus X-1, 
        identified by several researchers independently in 1971. [8][9] 

        Black holes of stellar mass form when massive stars collapse at the end of their life cycle. After a black hole has formed, it can grow by 
        absorbing mass from its surroundings. Supermassive black holes of millions of solar masses (M☉) may form by absorbing other stars and merging 
        with other black holes, or via direct collapse of gas clouds. There is consensus that supermassive black holes exist in the centers of most 
        galaxies. The presence of a black hole can be inferred through its interaction with other matter and with electromagnetic radiation such as 
        visible light. Any matter that falls toward a black hole can form an external accretion disk heated by friction, forming quasars, some of the 
        brightest objects in the universe. Stars passing too close to a supermassive black hole can be shredded into streamers that shine very brightly 
        before being "swallowed." [10] 
    
        If other stars are orbiting a black hole, their orbits can be used to determine the black hole's mass and location. Such observations can be 
        used to exclude possible alternatives such as neutron stars. In this way, astronomers have identified numerous stellar black hole candidates 
        in binary systems and established that the radio source known as Sagittarius A*, at the core of the Milky Way galaxy, contains a supermassive 
        black hole of about 4.3 million solar masses.

    <h1>History</h1>
    
    <p class="push-center">
        The idea of a body so big that even light could not escape was briefly proposed by English astronomical pioneer and clergyman John Michell and independently by French scientist Pierre-Simon Laplace. Both scholars proposed very large stars rather than the modern model of stars with extraordinary density.[11]

        Mitchel's idea appeared in a letter published in November 1784. Michell's simplistic calculations assumed such a body might have the same density as the Sun, and concluded that one would form when a star's diameter exceeds the Sun's by a factor of 500, and its surface escape velocity exceeds the usual speed of light. Michell correctly noted that such supermassive but non-radiating bodies might be detectable through their gravitational effects on nearby visible bodies.[11][12][13]

        In 1796, Laplace mentioned that a star could be invisible if it were sufficiently large while speculating on the origin of the Solar System in his book Exposition du Système du Monde. Franz Xaver von Zach asked Laplace for a mathematical analysis, which Laplace provided and published in journal edited by von Zach.[11]

        Scholars of the time were initially excited by the proposal that giant but invisible 'dark stars' might be hiding in plain view, but enthusiasm dampened when the wavelike nature of light became apparent in the early nineteenth century,[14] as if light were a wave rather than a particle, it was unclear what, if any, influence gravity would have on escaping light waves.[11][13]
